##  B. ABSTRACT 

Nowadays we live in era of abundance. For any given product, there are many of options to choose from. For example like streaming videos, social networking, online shopping; the list goes on. Recommender systems help to personalize a platform and help the user find something they like. The easiest and simplest way to do this is to recommend the most popular items. However, to really enhance the user experience through personalized recommendations, we need dedicated recommender systems. Therefore, our group develop the recommendation movie for the english movie. The movie from various of genres such as action, romantic, comedy, horor, documentation and etc.

*The figure shows the flow for the Movie Recommendation system.*

From the figure, we can see when user watch or rate a movie, the system will generate or display the similar movie for the user to watch. The recommendation maybe from the same genres or cast from the previous movie.

*The figure shows sample of the dataset.* 


We choose this three column because when someone watch the movie he or she want to know and watch the other movie that the same cast acting. From that the recommendation is helpful for the user.

This recommendation is c









## D.   PROJECT STRUCTURE

The following directory is our structure of our project:

$ tree --dirsfirst --filelimit 6

- ├── Output 2.png
- ├── SourceCode.py

6 files

The dataset/ directory contains the data described in the “Movie Recommendation System Dataset” section.

Two images provided are the examples of dataset from two types of movie recommended which is output 1 and output 2.







## E.  RESULT AND CONCLUSION



Nowadays, recommendation system is popular on various platform like Netflix,Amamzon, facebook and so on.This project is used to build movie recommendation system using python in machine learning environment. This is content based recommendation system where the system will take data from user, either user will click movie or rate any movie, so the system will save the information on its database and  suggest user the similar content. If user put more input the system will be more accurate.

 You can clerk in any movie that you want to watch and the system will provide 10 recommendation list of movies that related with.Here are our output:
